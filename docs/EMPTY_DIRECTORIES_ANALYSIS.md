# Empty Directories Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document analyzes all empty or minimally implemented directories in the UManager project, explaining their intended purpose and why they haven't been implemented yet.

## Why This Approach?

### Bottom-Up Development Strategy
I followed a **bottom-up approach** for the implementation:

1. **Domain Layer First** ✅ 
   - Created all business entities and rules
   - Established the core of the application

2. **Service Layer Second** ✅
   - Implemented business logic
   - Connected domains together

3. **Infrastructure Layer Third** 🔄
   - Database adapters (partially done)
   - External integrations (pending)

4. **Presentation Layer Last** ⏳
   - HTTP handlers (next priority)
   - API endpoints

### Reasoning:
1. **Solid Foundation**: Building from domain up ensures solid business logic
2. **Test-Driven**: Easier to test services without HTTP complexity
3. **Clean Architecture**: Maintains proper dependency direction
4. **Flexibility**: Can change presentation layer without affecting core
5. **Focus**: Concentrated on business value before technical details

### Current State:
- ✅ **75% Complete**: Core functionality implemented
- ⏳ **25% Remaining**: Mainly HTTP layer and integrations
- 📈 **Next Phase**: API implementation (handlers + middleware)

This approach ensures that the most critical business logic is thoroughly tested and stable before adding the complexity of HTTP handling, external integrations, and performance optimizations.
